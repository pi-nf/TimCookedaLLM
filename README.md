# TimCookedaLLM
It's Tim Cook, but as a LLM! (My best attempt that is). The model was trained on a dataset of Apple events from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nuhmanpk/101-apple-event-transcript-from-youtube) and then quickly cleaned for training.

The training process and code was mostly from this [brilliant tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quh7z1q7-uc) 


And it's also hosted on [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/spaces/pi-nf/TimCookedaLLM)


Enjoy!
